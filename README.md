- 👋 Hi, my name is Lucija. I'm a versatile software developer and consultant with rich Salesforce experience. I'm proficient in the entire project development cycle, 
    SQL and NoSQL database principles, HTML, CSS (SaSS/LeSS), JavaScript, Node.JS, C#, Java (and Salesforce native Apex), debugging, troubleshooting,
    problem-solving, client-relations, multitenant/multi-cloud architecture, integration, CRM systems, Sales and e-commerce clouds, as well as AI fundamentals.
    I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex business problems, and I aim to continuously expand my skill set and knowledge base.
- 👀 I’m interested in expanding my skillset to other cloud platforms, with the ambition of becoming a cloud architect.
      Exploring different aspects of cloud technology, including AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, excites me.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS and Azure fundamentals and advanced concepts,
                            Cloud architecture and design patterns,
                            Docker and Kubernetes for container orchestration,
                            Advanced JavaScript frameworks (e.g., React, Angular)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on various projects hosted on cloud platforms.
      Whether it's a simple web application or a complex cloud solution, I'm excited to work with and learn from like-minded individuals and teams.
